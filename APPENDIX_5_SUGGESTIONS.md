## Tips for Capturing Screenshots

1. **Use clear, high-resolution screenshots**
2. **Blur or anonymize sensitive data** (vendor names, phone numbers, amounts) if required
3. **Include date/time stamps** where relevant
4. **Show complete workflows** rather than isolated screens
5. **Add annotations** to highlight key features
6. **Use consistent formatting** for all figures
7. **Include both success and error scenarios**

---

## Sample Test Data to Use

For your test runs, consider using:
- **Test Vendors**: Create 3-5 test vendors with different scenarios (new, active, delinquent)
- **Test Periods**: Use a specific month (e.g., December 2025) for consistency
- **Test Amounts**: Use realistic but rounded amounts for clarity
- **Test Sections**: Include both wet and dry sections to show different billing scenarios

---

## Additional Notes

- All screenshots should be properly labeled (Figure 5.X)
- Include brief descriptions/discussions explaining what each screenshot demonstrates
- Show the progression of workflows where applicable
- Highlight unique features of your system
- Demonstrate both input and output clearly
